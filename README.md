# Letters made with HTML

Everytime I want to write a letter, I am afraid of aligning all text blocks
properly with a normal text processing program like Microsoft Word or
Libre Office. If I insert or delete a line, everything below it moves. And how
can I put the recipient's address at the right vertical position for the window
in the envelope, i.e. not half a line to far at the top or bottom? Sureâ€”I could
use text boxes, but everyone knows, how much they like to randomly jump to
another place on the page if you change something.

I want something that is easy to fill with content, with kind of an assurance
that the layout always stays the same. This is, where HTML with CSS comes in.
I no longer put text on the page and push it to the position I want it, but
I only write down the logical structure and contents of my letter. I don't have
to bother with anything layout-related. The powerful CSS then takes that
logically structured document and always aligns everything properly.
